		<h2>Pro Dev Activities</h2>
		<h3>My Learning Style</h3>
		<p><strong>Visual</strong></p>
		<p>25% Auditory</p>
		<p>35% Visual</p>
		<p>40% Tactile</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Quantivative</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>When I first got into Electronics I worked out of very small electronic company that employed 3 people including myself.
				I was made shop manger after a couple of years.
				During my tenure I was able to help build the business from working out of a garage to a 5,000-foot facility that employed 15 people.</li>
			<li>My second job in Electronics I was put in charge of a tech department for a software company that had been losing money for years.
				In my first year I was able to turn the department around, so it was making money for the company.</li>
			<li>In my last job I was part of a team that was able to build a full blown three bay tester from design to taking useable data within 6 months.
				We were also able to do it for under 1 million dollars.
				Our competitor had been working on the same project for 3 years and had spend 5 million on the project and they were never able to produce a tester that could take data.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Quantivative</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I can be very stubborn. The upshot of being stubborn is I don’t give up on problems very easily.
				The down side is I sometimes I don’t really hear someone ideas when they are better than mine.</li>
			<li>I like to mentor people. Helping others move forward in their careers is very rewarding.
				I have had to work late to finish a project because I spend several hours of my day mentoring people instead of getting my work done.</li>
			<li>I am a hard worker. Being a hard worker has helped me get where I am today and will help me get to my next goals in my career.
				I am really bad at work life balance which can hurt my social/family life.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>
		<p>My girlfriend was building a score board for her Derby club.
			I was asked to help when they could not get the hardware to work (she is a software person has not had to work with hardware in many years).
			I redesigned the PCB boards, wiring harnesses, and grounding scheme.
			While doing the electronics you have to use logic to solve the issues you also have to very creative.
			For example, doing the board layouts, you have to use parts in a way for the board to work, but you also want to lay it out in a way that some one that does not work with electronics can fix problem that might come up. Same with wiring harnesses.
			You want to run/build the cables so that if they need to be fixed and person with out any electrical experiences can do so.</p>

		<h3>Golden Circle</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Why: I want to build/design quietly products (website, apps, data acquisition) that I can be proud of.</li>
			<li>How:  I don’t just want my customers to have a “web presence” I want them to be excited to show off their website. </li>
			<li>What: How can I help them achieve this with their website.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>

		<h2>Informational Interview</h2>

		<h3>In Person Interview</h3>
		<p>I talked with Steve Leishman the VP of data and computer science at Xpansiv.
			He gave me the general rundown of what software they used and invited me to attend one of their lunch and learns in November to see more of what they do.</p>
		<h3>Website Interview</h3>
		<p>I looked up <a href="http://www.durangocomputers.com/">Durango Computers</a> online. They specialize mostly in PHP, ASP.NET, AJAX, Javascript, and HTML.</p>

		<h2>Salary Expectations</h2>
		<p>After doing some research, I’m expecting to make about 30-40K my first couple of years. I’m ok with that, because I really think I’m going to enjoy doing this type of work.</p>

      <h2>Game Relfections</h2>
		<p>The game went well for us as a group. We as a team communicated and worked with one another. When it was someone turn it was everyone turn. We talked about what the best move was for the group, not what was best for the individual. Granted this is the honeymoon phase of the team and there will be plenty of aggravation with one another. I think we can put aside our differences and remind ourselves of the group goal. </p>

		<h2> Team Contract</h2>
		<a href="Backyard%20Astronomers%20Contract.pdf" target="_blank">Contact we have with one another</a>

		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<h3>week 1</h3>
		<P>First week is in the books and it was what I expected. A lot of highs (hey, I solved a problem, I belong here) and a lot of lows (I am so lost, maybe I don’t belong here).
			I am very lucky and have a lot of great people in my cohort.
			Everyone is so willing to help each other out.
			I have learned a lot this week and I can’t wait for Monday to start. </P>

		<h3>week 2</h3>
		<p>This week was a complete blur. I really can’t believe how fast it went.
			I feel like I learned a lot, but I’m not really sure.
			My list of things I feel I need to work grows by the day and the amount of hours in the day seem to be getting shorter.
			I do like the fact I feel our fullstack group is grow closer each day. They are all really great people. </p>

		<h3>week 3</h3>
		<p>I can’t believe week three in the books. I’m starting to get a feel at what I’m good at and what I need to work on. Boy do I need a lot of work.</p>

		<h3>week 4</h3>
		<p>This week has been non stop excitement. Between starting out capstone project, pro-dev, bootstrap challenge, and all other little project, I really have not had time to think about much else. </p>

		<h3>week 5</h3>
		<p>This week was very social one. Between going to Fatpipe and Xpansiv I actually did a lot of networking. I did not really find a place in the conversation to use my elevator pitch but did talk to several people about what I was doing, and what my plans for the future are. I did not get the opportunity to talk to any alumni, but hopefully in the next couple of weeks. </p>
